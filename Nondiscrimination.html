<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt"><span style="font-family:Roboto,sans-serif"><span style="color:#222222">Last Revised:&nbsp;November 20, 2023</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt"><span style="font-family:Roboto,sans-serif"><span style="color:#222222">ChargEasy LLC is, at its core, an open community dedicated to bringing the world closer together by fostering meaningful, shared experiences among people from all parts of the world. Our community includes millions of people from virtually every country on the globe. It is an incredibly diverse community, drawing together individuals of different cultures, values, and norms.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt"><span style="font-family:Roboto,sans-serif"><span style="color:#222222">The ChargEasy LLC community is committed to building a world where people from every background feel welcome and respected, no matter how far they have traveled from home. This commitment rests on two foundational principles that apply both to ChargEasy LLC’s hosts and guests: <b>inclusion and respect</b>. Our shared commitment to these principles enables all members of our community to feel welcome on the ChargEasy LLC platform no matter who they are, where they come from, how they worship, or whom they love. ChargEasy LLC recognizes that some jurisdictions permit, or require, distinctions among individuals based on factors such as national origin, gender, marital status or sexual orientation, and it does not require hosts to violate local laws or take actions that may subject them to legal liability. ChargEasy LLC will provide additional guidance and adjust this nondiscrimination policy to reflect such permissions and requirements in the jurisdictions where they exist.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt"><span style="font-family:Roboto,sans-serif"><span style="color:#222222">While we do not believe that one company can mandate harmony among all people, we do believe that the ChargEasy LLC community can promote empathy and understanding across all cultures. We are all committed to doing everything we can to help eliminate all forms of unlawful bias, discrimination, and intolerance from our platform. We want to promote a culture within the ChargEasy LLC community—hosts, guests and people just considering whether to use our platform—that goes above and beyond mere compliance. To that end, all of us, ChargEasy LLC employees, hosts and guests alike, agree to read and act in accordance with the following policy to strengthen our community and realize our mission of ensuring that everyone can belong, and feels welcome, anywhere.</span></span></p>

<ul>
  <li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="font-size:10.5pt"><span style="font-family:Roboto,sans-serif"><span style="color:#222222"><strong>Inclusion</strong></span></span></span><span style="font-size:10.5pt"><span style="font-family:Roboto,sans-serif"><span style="color:#222222"> &#8212; We welcome people of all backgrounds with authentic hospitality and open minds. Joining ChargEasy LLC, as a host or guest, means becoming part of a community of inclusion. Bias, prejudice, racism, and hatred have no place on our platform or in our community. While hosts are required to follow all applicable laws that prohibit discrimination based on such factors as race, religion, national origin, and others listed below, we commit to do more than comply with the minimum requirements established by law.</span></span></span></li>
  <li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="font-size:10.5pt"><span style="font-family:Roboto,sans-serif"><span style="color:#222222"><strong>Respect</strong></span></span></span><span style="font-size:10.5pt"><span style="font-family:Roboto,sans-serif"><span style="color:#222222"> &#8212; We are respectful of each other in our interactions and encounters. ChargEasy LLC appreciates that local laws and cultural norms vary around the world and expects hosts and guests to abide by local laws, and to engage with each other respectfully, even when views may not reflect their beliefs or upbringings. ChargEasy LLC’s members bring to our community an incredible diversity of background experiences, beliefs, and customs. By connecting people from different backgrounds, ChargEasy LLC fosters greater understanding and appreciation for the common characteristics shared by all human beings and undermines prejudice rooted in misconception, misinformation, or misunderstanding.</span></span></span></li>

<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt"><span style="font-family:Roboto,sans-serif"><span style="color:#222222">As a general matter, we will familiarize ourselves with all applicable federal, state, and local laws that apply to housing and places of public accommodation. Some jurisdictions may have additional legal requirements that expand or limit the civil right protections of the user community. Hosts are required to comply with such legal requirements. Hosts should contact ChargEasy LLC customer service if they have any questions about their obligations to comply with this ChargEasy LLC Nondiscrimination Policy. ChargEasy LLC will release further discrimination policy guidance for jurisdictions outside the United States in the near future. Guided by these principles, our U.S., EU, and Canadian host community will follow these rules when considering potential guests and hosting guests:</span></span></span></p>

Hosts should make every effort to be welcoming to guests of all backgrounds. Hosts who demonstrate a pattern of rejecting guests from a protected class (even while articulating legitimate reasons) undermine the strength of our community by making potential guests feel unwelcome, and ChargEasy LLC may suspend hosts who have demonstrated such a pattern from the ChargEasy LLC platform.</span></span></span></p>


<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:Roboto,sans-serif"><span style="color:#222222"><strong>Specific Guidance for Hosts Outside the United States, European Union, and Canada</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt"><span style="font-family:Roboto,sans-serif"><span style="color:#222222">Outside of the United States, the European Union, and Canada, some countries or communities may allow or even require people to make accommodation distinctions based on, for example, marital status, national origin, gender or sexual orientation, in violation of our general nondiscrimination philosophy. In these cases, we do not require hosts to violate local laws, nor to accept guests that could expose the hosts to a real and demonstrable risk of arrest, or physical harm to their persons or property. Hosts who live in such areas should set out any such restriction on their ability to host particular guests in their listing, so that prospective guests are aware of the issue and ChargEasy LLC can confirm the necessity for such an action. In communicating any such restrictions, we expect hosts to use clear, factual, non-derogatory terms. Slurs and insults have no place on our platform or in our community.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:Roboto,sans-serif"><span style="color:#222222"><strong>What happens when a host does not comply with our policies in this area?</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt"><span style="font-family:Roboto,sans-serif"><span style="color:#222222">If a particular listing contains language contrary to this nondiscrimination policy, the host will be asked to remove the language and affirm his or her understanding and intent to comply with this policy and its underlying principles. ChargEasy LLC may also, in its discretion, take steps up to and including suspending the host from the ChargEasy LLC platform.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt"><span style="font-family:Roboto,sans-serif"><span style="color:#222222">If the host improperly rejects guests on the basis of a protected class or uses language demonstrating that his or her actions were motivated by factors prohibited by this policy, ChargEasy LLC will take steps to enforce this policy, up to and including suspending the host from the platform.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt"><span style="font-family:Roboto,sans-serif"><span style="color:#222222">As the ChargEasy LLC community grows, we will continue to ensure that ChargEasy LLC’s policies and practices align with our most important goal: To ensure that guests and hosts feel welcome and respected in all of their interactions using the ChargEasy LLC platform. The public, our community, and we ourselves expect no less than this.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:Roboto,sans-serif"><span style="color:#222222"><strong>Additional Considerations</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt"><span style="font-family:Roboto,sans-serif"><span style="color:#222222">The Nondiscrimination Policy applies to all parts of the ChargEasy LLC business. We recognize there are additional considerations that need to be made for varied offerings in the ChargEasy LLC Community. Here, we have included a few considerations that speak to those instances:</span></span></span></p>

  <li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="font-size:10.5pt"><span style="font-family:Roboto,sans-serif"><span style="color:#222222">Provide factually accurate information about the physical nature of an Experience to allow guests to assess for themselves whether the Experience is appropriate given their individual needs.</span></span></span></li>
  <li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="font-size:10.5pt"><span style="font-family:Roboto,sans-serif"><span style="color:#222222">Actively engage with guests who have disclosed disabilities and/or have questions regarding the accessibility of an experience, and to consider reasonable accommodation requests.</span></span></span></li>
  <li style="list-style-type:disc"><span style="font-size:10.5pt"><span style="font-family:Roboto,sans-serif"><span style="color:#222222">Seek opportunities to provide reasonable accommodations where accommodating a request would not substantively change the nature of the activity.</span></span></span></li>
