		    <h2>A Brief History of EVs and How the ChargEasy App Will Be the Next Extension of the EV Market </h2>
			 <span class="blogdate"><img src="assets/img/calendar.svg"/>19 Dec 2023</span>
				<div class="blogs-content mt-3">
			<p>Electric vehicles (EVs) have been around for over a century, but they haven't always been popular. In the early days of EVs, the batteries were too heavy and expensive, and the range was limited. But in recent years, as battery technology has improved and the cost of EVs has come down, EVs have become increasingly popular.</p>

<p>In 1828, √Ånyos Jedlik, a Hungarian inventor, created the first working model of an electric car. However, it wasn't until the late 19th century that EVs began to be mass-produced. In 1897, William Morrison, an American inventor, created the first practical EV. Morrison's EV had a top speed of 14 mph and a range of 50 miles.</p>

<p>In the early 1900s, EVs were quite popular, accounting for about a third of all vehicles on the road in the United States. However, the popularity of EVs declined in the 1920s with the introduction of the Ford Model T, which was much cheaper and easier to operate than EVs.</p>

<p>The interest in EVs revived in the 1970s due to the oil crisis. However, it wasn't until the late 1990s that EVs began to gain mainstream popularity. In 1997, Toyota released the Prius, which was the first mass-produced hybrid vehicle. The Prius was a huge success, and it helped to reintroduce EVs to the public.</p>

<p>In recent years, the EV market has grown rapidly. In 2022, global EV sales increased by 108% compared to the previous year. This growth is being driven by a number of factors, including declining costs, improved performance, and government incentives.</p>

<p>The ChargEasy app is poised to be the next extension of the EV market. ChargEasy makes it easy for EV owners to find and use charging stations. The app also allows people with home chargers to list their chargers for rent. This can help to address the need for more charging infrastructure as the EV market continues to grow.</p>

<h4 class="mt-3">Here are some of the ways that ChargEasy is extending the EV market:</h4>

<p><b>Making it easier to find and use charging stations:</b> ChargEasy makes it easy for EV owners to find charging stations near them. The app also provides information on the availability, price, and charging speed of charging stations.</p>

<p><b>Allowing people to share their home chargers:</b> ChargEasy allows people with home chargers to list their chargers for rent. This can help to address the need for more charging infrastructure as the EV market continues to grow.</p>

<p><b>Promoting the adoption of EVs:</b> ChargEasy is promoting the adoption of EVs by making it easier for people to own and use EVs. The app also provides information about the benefits of EVs, such as their lower operating costs and reduced environmental impact.</p>

<p>The ChargEasy app is a valuable tool for EV owners and people who are considering purchasing an EV. The app makes it easier to find and use charging stations, and it also promotes the adoption of EVs.</p>
