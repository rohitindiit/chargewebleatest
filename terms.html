The Host retains the right to re-enter the Accommodation during your stay, to the extent: (i) it is reasonably necessary, (ii) permitted by your contract with the Host, and (iii) consistent with applicable law. If you stay past checkout, the Host has the right to make you leave in a manner consistent with applicable law, including by imposing reasonable overstay penalties.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

You are responsible for informing the Host of any medical or physical or other circumstances that may impact your ability to participate, attend, or use the Host Service.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

You are responsible and liable for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of anyone you invite to join or provide access to any Accommodation, Experience or other Host Service. For example, this means: (i) you are responsible for leaving an Accommodation (and related personal property) in the condition it was in when you arrived, (ii) you are responsible for paying all reasonable Damage Claim amounts necessary to cover damage that you, your guest(s), or your pet(s) cause to an Accommodation, and (iii) you must act with integrity, treat others with respect, and comply with applicable laws at all times. If you are booking for an additional guest who is a minor or if you bring a minor to a Host Service, you must be legally authorized to act on behalf of the minor and you are solely responsible for the supervision of that minor.</span></span></span></p>

This means it is your responsibility to investigate a Host Service to determine whether it is suitable for you. For example, Host Services may carry risk of illness, bodily injury, disability, or death, and you freely and willfully assume those risks by choosing to participate in those Host Services.</strong></span></span></span></p>

Your Listing must include complete and accurate information about your Host Service, your price, other charges like after-hours fees, or offline fees, and any rules or requirements that apply to your Guests or Listing. You are responsible for your acts and omissions as well as for keeping your Listing information (including calendar availability) and content (like photos) up-to-date and accurate at all times. You are responsible for obtaining appropriate insurance for your Host Services and we suggest you carefully review policy terms and conditions including coverage details and exclusions. You may only maintain one Listing per Accommodation unless you have multiple EV Charging stations at your property.</span></span></span></p>

You are responsible for understanding and complying with any laws, rules, regulations and contracts with third parties that apply to your Host Services. For example: Some landlords and leases, or homeowner and condominium association rules, restrict or prohibit EV Stations. Some cities have zoning or other laws that could restrict hosting in a residential area. Some jurisdictions require Hosts to register, get a permit, or obtain a license before providing certain Host Services.&nbsp; In some area, the Host Services you want to offer may be prohibited altogether. Some jurisdictions require that you register Guests who stay at your Accommodation. Some jurisdictions have laws that create tenancy rights for Guests and additional obligations for Hosts. Check your local rules to learn what rules apply to the Host Services you plan to offer. Information we provide regarding legal requirements is for informational purposes only and you should independently confirm your obligations. You are responsible for handling and using personal data of Guests and others in compliance with applicable privacy laws and these Terms, including our&nbsp;</span></span></span><a href="http://www.chargeasy.org/terms.html" style="text-decoration:none"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:inherit"><span style="color:#0000ff"><u>Host Privacy Standards</u></span></span></span><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:Roboto,sans-serif"><span style="color:#0000ff"><u>.</u></span></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:Roboto,sans-serif"><span style="color:#000000"> </span></span></span><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:Roboto,sans-serif"><span style="color:#222222">If you have questions about how local laws apply you should always seek legal advice.</span></span></span></p>

In the event that a claim, cause of action or requested remedy is severed pursuant to this paragraph, then you and we agree that the claims, causes of action or requested remedies that are not subject to arbitration will be stayed until all arbitrable claims, causes of action and requested remedies are resolved by the arbitrator.</span></span></span></p>
