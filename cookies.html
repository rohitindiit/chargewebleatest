<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt"><span style="font-family:Roboto,sans-serif"><span style="color:#222222">We collect many different types of information from server logs and other technologies. For example, we collect information about the device you use to access the ChargEasy LLC Platform, your operating system type, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located.

<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt"><span style="font-family:Roboto,sans-serif"><span style="color:#222222"><strong>Third Parties</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt"><span style="font-family:Roboto,sans-serif"><span style="color:#222222">ChargEasy LLC permits third parties to collect the information described above through our Service and discloses such information to third parties for business purposes as described in this Privacy Policy, including but not limited to providing advertising on our Service and elsewhere based on users’ online activities over time and across different sites, services, and devices.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt"><span style="font-family:Roboto,sans-serif"><span style="color:#222222">Third parties, including Facebook, place technologies such as pixels and SDKs on the ChargEasy LLC Platform. These technologies (1) help us analyze how you use the ChargEasy LLC Platform, such as by noting the third party services from which you arrived, (2) market and advertise ChargEasy LLC services to you on the ChargEasy LLC Platform and third party websites, (3) help us detect or prevent fraud or conduct risk assessments, and (4) collect information about your activities on the ChargEasy LLC Platform, other sites, and/or the ads you have clicked on. For example, to help us better understand how people use the ChargEasy LLC Platform, we work with a number of analytics partners, including Google Analytics. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser by <a href=https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout style="text-decoration:none"><span style="font-size:10.5pt"><span style="font-family:inherit"><span style="color:#0000ff"><u><strong>clicking here</strong></u></span></span></span></a>.

<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt"><span style="font-family:Roboto,sans-serif"><span style="color:#222222">Third parties, including Facebook, may also use such tracking technologies to collect or receive information from the ChargEasy LLC Platform and elsewhere and use that information to serve ads that they believe are most likely to be of interest to you and measure the effectiveness of their ads both on the ChargEasy LLC Platform and on other websites and online services. Targeting and advertising cookies we use may include Google, and other advertising networks and services we use from time to time.

To the extent advertising technology is integrated into the ChargEasy LLC Platform and you opt-out of tailored advertising, you may still receive advertising content. In that case, the advertising content will just not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of these opt-out links and are not responsible for the availability or accuracy of these mechanisms. Users can opt-out of the collection and use of information for ad targeting by updating their Facebook account ad settings and by contacting opt-out@ChargEasy.org with a description of your request and validation information. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt"><span style="font-family:Roboto,sans-serif"><span style="color:#222222">The ChargEasy LLC Platform may use social plugins provided and operated by third parties, such as Facebook’s Like Button. As a result of this, you may send to the third party the information that you are viewing on a certain part of the ChargEasy LLC Platform. If you are not logged into your account with the third party, then the third party may not know your identity. If you are logged in to your account with the third party, then the third party may be able to link information or actions about your interactions with the ChargEasy LLC Platform to your account with them. Please refer to the third party’s privacy policies to learn more about its data practices.</span></span></span></p>

While you may disable cookies through your browser settings, the ChargEasy LLC Platform currently does not respond to a “Do Not Track” signal in the HTTP header from your browser or mobile application due to lack of standardization regarding how that signal should be interpreted.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.5pt"><span style="font-family:Roboto,sans-serif"><span style="color:#222222">Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies, and cookie management tools available in a web browser will not remove flash cookies.
